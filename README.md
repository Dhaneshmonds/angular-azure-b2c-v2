- A modern web browser. This sample uses **ES6** conventions and will not run on **Internet Explorer**.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended for running and editing this sample.
- [VS Code Azure Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) extension is recommended for interacting with Azure through VS Code Interface.
